# Code War Solutions - Brett Crafton
Solutions to https://www.codewars.com/ (Code Wars) that I have completed.<br>

If you have not completed these yourself, be aware these contain spoilers.

Some solutions will be done with best practices in mind, some I will try to do in 1 line, and some I timed myself. All to best challenge myself.
