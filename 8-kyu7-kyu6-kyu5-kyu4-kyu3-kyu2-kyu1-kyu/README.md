# Code War Solutions - Brett Crafton

Solutions to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.codewars.com/r/muPVgA">CodeWars</a> that I have completed.<br>

![Codewars](https://github.r2v.ch/codewars?user=bcrafton&name=true&top_languages=true&stroke=%23BB432C)

***If you have not completed these yourself, be aware these contain spoilers.***

## My approach:

Some solutions will be done with best practices in mind, some I will try to do in 1 line, and some I timed myself (speed was most important factor). All to better challenge myself.

Some challenges I have adopted the P.R.E.P. method. "Parameters, Return, Examples, Pseudo Code"
