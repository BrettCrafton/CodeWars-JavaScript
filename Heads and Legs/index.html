	#Description

	Everybody has probably heard of the animal heads and legs problem 
	from the earlier years at school. It goes:
	
	“A farm contains chickens and cows. There are x heads and y legs. How 
	many chickens and cows are there?”
	
	Where x <= 1000 and y <=1000
	
	#Task
	
	Assuming there are no other types of animals, work out how many of 
	each animal are there.
	
	Return a tuple in Python - (chickens, cows) and an array list - 
	[chickens, cows]/{chickens, cows} in all other languages
	
	If either the heads & legs is negative, the result of your calculation 
	is negative or the calculation is a float return "No solutions" 
	(no valid cases), or [-1, -1] in COBOL.
	
	In the form:

	However, if 0 heads and 0 legs are given always return [0, 0] since 
	zero heads must give zero animals.

	There are many different ways to solve this, but they all give the 
	same answer.

	You will only be given integers types - however negative values 
	(edge cases) will be given.

	Happy coding!

	[Heads, Legs] = [72, 200]

	VALID - [72, 200] =>             [44 , 28]   
									[Chickens, Cows]
	
	INVALID - [72, 201] => "No solutions"
